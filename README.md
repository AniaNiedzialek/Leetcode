# Leetcode Practice Solutions

Welcome to my Leetcode practice repository!

This repo contains my personal solutions to coding problems from *Leetcode*, aimed at strengthening my problem-solving skills and preparing for technical interviews.

##  About

The solutions are written in Python and cover a wide range of topics such as:
- Arrays and Strings
- Linked Lists
- Trees and Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- Recursion
- and more!

Each script typically includes comments, edge case handling, and occasionally notes on time/space complexity.
I also included some quick refreshers both in Python and Java.

## Features

- Clean, well-commented Python code
- Covers multiple difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- Tested with sample inputs
- Focused on clarity and understanding, not just passing

## Progress

I'm currently devoted to solve at least **3 problems per day** to build consistency and depth in coding practice. Check the commit history to see daily updates.

## Tools

- Python 3.x
- Leetcode Online Judge
- VS Code / Jupyter
